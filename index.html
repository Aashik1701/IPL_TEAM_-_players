                        Royal Challengers Bangalore, also known as RCB, is the Bengaluru-based cricket franchise of the Indian Premier League (IPL). The team is owned by United Spirits Limited, a Diageo Group company. RCB rose from a bottom-two finish in 2008 to end as runners-up in 2009 and semi-finalists in 2010. The team had 3 good seasons back-to-back when they made it to the final in 2011. Led by Virat Kohli, Royal Challengers Bangalore yet again finished 2nd in 2016.

                        Chennai Super Kings (CSK) is a cricket franchise based in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India. The team is captained by Mahendra Singh Dhoni and is one of the most successful teams in the Indian Premier League (IPL). CSK has won the IPL title three times and has consistently performed well in the tournament.

Co-owned by the GMR Group and the JSW Group, Delhi Capitals was established in 2008 as Delhi Daredevils before embracing a new avatar in December 2019. The men's team is coached by Australian legend Ricky Ponting and is being captained by David Warner for the 2023 season. The women's team is coached by Jonathan Batty, and captained by Meg Lanning.

                        One of the most high-profile teams in the tournament, Mumbai Indians are tied with Chennai Super Kings as the most successful, with five titles. The franchise was purchased by the Reliance conglomerate for about Rs 487 crore (US$112 million) in 2008, making it the most expensive team in the league at the time. Mumbai's star-studded line-up, which has featured the likes of Sachin Tendulkar and Sanath Jayasuriya, first made a mark in 2010, when they finished runners-up. In the next two years, they strengthened their core by picking Rohit Sharma, Zaheer Khan and Kieron Pollard.

                        Sunrisers Hyderabad entered the IPL in 2013, after the previous Hyderabad-based franchise, Deccan Chargers, was dissolved due to prolonged financial issues. The SRH franchise was bought by Sun TV Network for Rs 85.05 crores (about US$15.9 million) per year for a five-year deal. Sunrisers began to shape their own identity in 2015, when David Warner was made captain. The team finished sixth that year, but unlike his predecessors, Warner retained the captaincy on the back of his own strong performances.

                        Punjab Kings (previously Kings XI Punjab) was bought for Rs 304 crore (about US$76 million) in 2008 by Mohit Burman, Ness Wadia, Preity Zinta and Karan Paul. The only franchises that went for lower were Rajasthan Royals (Rs 268 crore, $67 million) and Kolkata Knight Riders (Rs 300 crore, $75.09 million). Punjab, who changed their name ahead of the 2021 IPL, have got to the final only once. They had a promising start in the first season, but haven't enjoyed consistent success, lacking a stable core.

                        The team that attracted the smallest bid when the IPL franchises were first sold, Rajasthan Royals emerged unlikely champions in the first season. Since then they have blown hot and cold, reaching the playoffs four times and finishing sixth or below seven times. They have also been hit by controversy off the field. In 2010 there was a court battle over ownership. In 2013, three of their players were arrested on charges of spot-fixing, and following an investigation, the franchise was suspended for two years for its involvement in illegal betting and match-fixing.

                        Under Sourav Ganguly and then Brendon McCullum, KKR's first three years were forgettable. They had the likes of Ricky Ponting, Chris Gayle and (briefly) Shoaib Akhtar in their ranks, alongside promising young Indians like Ishant Sharma, but the highest they finished in the first three seasons was sixth. In 2011, KKR made their first playoffs under Gautam Gambhir. Yusuf Pathan became a key member of the side, along with Jacques Kallis. In 2012, KKR won their first title, thanks in part to new signings Sunil Narine and Robin Uthappa.

                        Gujarat Titans were one of two new teams introduced ahead of the 2022 season. CVC Capital Partners won the franchise bid for Rs 5625 crore (approx US$750 million). They picked Hardik Pandya, Rashid Khan and Shubman Gill ahead of the 2022 auction. Pandya was named captain. Ashish Nehra was appointed head coach, Gary Kirsten mentor and batting coach, and Vikram Solanki director of cricket.

US$940 million) by RP Sanjiv Goenka Group, which previously owned the Rising Pune Supergiant franchise in 2016 and 2017. Andy Flower was appointed head coach and Gautam Gambhir mentor.
